# Geeetech-A10M
Repository of my 3D Printer Geeetech A10M

The printer is based on an A10M from Geeetech.
The has an mixing extruder with two inputs, but it does not work well.
It often get stuck and it is really time-consuming to get it back working.

Therefore i changed the hotend to an Diamond Hotend

It has three inputs and has less problems with clogging.

Because the original mainboard broke, it replaced it with a better one.

Original mainboard:
Geeetech GT2560 V3.0
